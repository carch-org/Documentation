<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

Let’s be real—I didn’t create the TUI for the `Carch` project from scratch. My `amazing noob skills` in Rust made that impossible. Instead, all credit goes to the [`ChrisTitusTech LinUtil project`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil) and its [`Contributors`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/graphs/contributors). Thanks to its `MIT` license, I was able to use their TUI for my project. However, the bash scripts inside the TUI? Those are my creation.  


Now, `Carch` doesn’t fully depend on this TUI. It’s just an extra feature to make things more user-friendly. While the TUI lets you run `Carch` scripts, it’s not exactly the same as the main scripts. For example, I had to remove `gum` for menu and item selection to make it work. Instead, you’ll need to type your options in the TUI. These are small changes and won’t affect how the scripts work much.  

Keep in mind, the TUI is still in development, so bugs might pop up. If you find any, please let me know, and I’ll fix them as soon as I can.  

Lastly, a big thank you to [`ChrisTitusTech`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech) and the [`Contributors`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/graphs/contributors). Your work in the Linux community is amazing, and I’m grateful to have been able to use your project as part of mine.
