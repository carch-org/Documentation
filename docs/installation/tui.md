Let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt create the TUI for the `Carch` project from scratch. My `amazing noob skills` in Rust made that impossible. Instead, all credit goes to the [`ChrisTitusTech LinUtil project`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil) and its [`Contributors`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/graphs/contributors). Thanks to its `MIT` license, I was able to use their TUI for my project. However, the bash scripts inside the TUI? Those are my creation.  


Now, `Carch` doesn‚Äôt fully depend on this TUI. It‚Äôs just an extra feature to make things more user-friendly. While the TUI lets you run `Carch` scripts, it‚Äôs not exactly the same as the main scripts. For example, I had to remove `gum` for menu and item selection to make it work. Instead, you‚Äôll need to type your options in the TUI. These are small changes and won‚Äôt affect how the scripts work much.  

Keep in mind, the TUI is still in development, so bugs might pop up. If you find any, please let me know, and I‚Äôll fix them as soon as I can.  

Lastly, a big thank you to [`ChrisTitusTech`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech) and the [`Contributors`](https://github.com/ChrisTitusTech/linutil/graphs/contributors). Your work in the Linux community is amazing, and I‚Äôm grateful to have been able to use your project as part of mine.  

### Installation

**To install, use the main script available [here](https://carch-org.github.io/docs/installation/cli.html).**

> [!NOTE]
> This TUI is an **optional feature** for a more user-friendly experience. 
>
> The main `carch` script remains unaffected and works independently.  
>
> The TUI is **still in development**, so bugs may appear. Feel free to report them for a quick fix!

### **Contributing to TUI**

Thank you for considering contributing to Carch! Your efforts help improve the project, and we‚Äôre excited to have you on board. Follow these simple guidelines to ensure a smooth contribution process.


#### üì¶ **1. Install Rust**  
Before you start, ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by following the instructions at [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).  


#### üç¥ **2. Fork and Clone the Repository**  

- Fork the repository on GitHub.  
- Clone your forked repository locally by running:  

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/carch.git
  cd carch
  ```  


#### ‚úèÔ∏è  **3. Make Your Changes**  

- **Edit Files**: Modify the relevant files to implement your changes.  
- **Test Your Changes**: Use the following command to test your modifications:  
 
  ```sh
  cargo run
  ```
  
  This will execute the project locally to ensure everything works as expected.  


#### üß† **4. Understand the Existing Code**  

- **Have a Clear Reason**: Avoid making unnecessary changes. Be prepared to explain why your updates are essential and how they improve the project.  
- **Follow Conventions**: Ensure your changes align with the existing coding style, design patterns, and overall project goals. Justify new methods or patterns clearly if introduced.  

#### üîé **5. Learn from Past Pull Requests (PRs)**  

- **Review Merged PRs**: Study previously merged PRs to understand what types of contributions are accepted.  
- **Check Rejected PRs**: Avoid repeating mistakes or proposing changes that were previously declined.  

#### üìù **6. Write Clean, Descriptive Commit Messages**  

- **Be Clear**: Describe what the commit does and why the change was made.  
- **Use the Imperative Mood**: For example, "Add feature X" or "Fix bug Y" instead of "Added feature X" or "Fixed bug Y".  
- **Keep Commits Clean**: Avoid committing changes followed by immediate fixes. Instead, amend your commits or squash them if necessary.  

#### üîí **7. Keep Pull Requests (PRs) Small and Focused**  

- **One Feature or Fix per PR**: Small, targeted PRs are easier to review and more likely to be accepted.  
- **Avoid Unrelated Changes**: Grouping unrelated updates in a single PR can complicate reviews and result in rejections.  

#### ‚úÖ **8. Understand and Test the Code You Write**  

- **Code Review**: Check your code for readability, performance, and efficiency.  
- **No Blind Submissions**: Avoid submitting AI-generated code without fully understanding and testing it.  
- **Testing is Mandatory**: Ensure your code works as intended. PRs without proper testing may be rejected.  

#### üí¨ **9. Code Review and Feedback**  

- **Be Open to Feedback**: PRs will be reviewed, and feedback will be provided. Be ready to adjust your changes accordingly.  
- **Review Others‚Äô PRs**: If you feel comfortable, help review other contributors‚Äô PRs. This fosters collaboration and ensures high-quality contributions.  

#### üé® **10. Contributions Beyond Code**  

- **Test the Tool**: Running the project in various environments and providing feedback is invaluable.  
- **Report Issues**: Clearly describe any bugs or problems you encounter, providing detailed reproduction steps.  
- **Suggest Features**: Propose new features with clear reasoning and use cases, ensuring they align with the project‚Äôs scope and style.  

#### üìú **License**  

By contributing to Carch, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the project‚Äôs [GPL license](https://github.com/harilvfs/carch/blob/main/LICENSE).  

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you to make Carch even better!
